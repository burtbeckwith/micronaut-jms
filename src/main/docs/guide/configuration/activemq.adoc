If you are using a supported message broker (currently only ActiveMQ)
then you will need to add the following properties to your `application.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  jms:
    activemq:
      enabled: true
      connection-string: 'tcp://host:61616'
----

and the following to your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`

dependency:io.micronaut.jms:micronaut-jms-activemq[]
