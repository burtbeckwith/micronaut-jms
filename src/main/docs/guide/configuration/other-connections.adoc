= Configuring Connections for Unsupported Brokers

If your message broker is not supported, then you must provide the `ConnectionFactory` manually to the `BeanContext` in the following manner:

[source,java]
----
@Factory
public class JMSConfig {
    @JMSConnectionFactory("myConnectionFactory")
    public ConnectionFactory connFactory() {
        return new ActiveMqConnectionFactory("tcp://host:616161");
    }
}
----

Once you have these changes in place, you can start defining listeners and producers.
